# PARCEL-SANDBOX

This is my parcel sandbox to have a easy, fast, and minimal React prototyping tool

## Building and running on localhost

Run the project in hot module reloading mode:
```sh
make start
```

To create a production build:

```sh
make build
```

## Running

Open the file `dist/index.html` in your browser
